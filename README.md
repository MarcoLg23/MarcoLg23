Hi, my name is Marco Lavarrios, I'm a college student in Computer Systems Engineering.

Passionate for IoT topics and currently learning everything about it.
Some of the programming languages, protocols and other stuff that I've been learning is:
  - Arduino
  - C/C++
  - Python/MycroPython
  - Lua
  - MQTT
  - AWS / GCP / Azure Core
  - Firebase
  - Flutter
  - Javascript / React & Vue
  - HTTP/HTTPS
  

Currently working on a better looking profile readme. :)

Never show them your source code.
